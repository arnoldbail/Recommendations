Steps to installation checklist:

- Install Adaptivetheme and Sky sub-themes. (This theme is not required; but, AT Sky worked well in a mobile environment.

- Install the WYSIWYG module and enable it. The Wysiwyg editor  is not required; but, it does make it a better experience for the recommendlate creator.

- Install and enable the Recommendation module package.

- Login as admin. Click dashboard and run either or both the setup demo icons. This creates the professor and student roled, the drdemo, drdemo2 and student usernames and the professor and studedent menus. The setup2 icon does the same thing; but, for different usernames.

- Content type->recommendlate->edit, disable all of the comment
	  settings.
	
- If you didn't run detup, create "professor" and "student" roles. Give permissions for 
  recommendlate   items to "professor" role. Give Advanced Help" permisssion to Professor and Student roles.

- Create a user for each professor. Give professor role. Give an email
  address that will be used when creating a professor profile.
  
- Create "professor" and "student" menus structure->menus=>add menu. After creating the menus, click "list items" for professor and add "Recommendations" link to point to the dashboard "recommendations". For the "student" menu add Recommendations and link to "recommendations/recommends_req" and "Email Professor" to "recommends_req/profemail".

- In structure->blocks drag and drop the professor and student menus to the "Drop Down" region. Click configure for professor and check "professor" role. Do the same for the student item and check student role.

- Go to Administration =>Configuration -> Search and metadata and check the Advanced Help box. Remember that for search or advanced help index to work, Cron must be run. In administration->cron and set the interval to 3 hours or less and then, if desired run cron manually.
