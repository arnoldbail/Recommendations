<p>The Professor Contacts table is used by the professor to save and access school contact resources. Typically, a student won't have the contact information for a school that was requested. The school willl need to be contacted to get the contact information. For individual schools, this is stored on the Schools table for the student. But, occasionally, a central site is used by many schools. This requires a username and password, which the professor stores on the contact table. </p>
