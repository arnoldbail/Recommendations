<p>College professors often are requested by their students to write Recommendation Letters to other colleges for contnued graduate studies or for research opportunities. Professors who teaxh graduate courses need to expend a considerable effort at year's end writing these letters and sending them to their requested schools. The information the professor needs from the student is often incomplete and needs several iterations of emails to get the information. Then when there are many requests, the professor must keep the information organized for each student until the letters are written. The Recommendations system is meant to solve or alleviate much of this burden upon the professor. See the Recommendation Process below. It can be seen that this system involves a multitude of  functions: Forms, Database, file, email, recommendation creation, online menus. The application was designed to comfortably use a mobile device (i.e., iPhone. Android) if needed.</p>
